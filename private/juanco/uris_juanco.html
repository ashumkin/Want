<h1>Notes on Want Development</h1>
<p><i>by Juanco Añez</i></p>
<h2>URIs</h2>
<p>Users should be able to specify URIs most everywhere the path to a resource
is required. For example:</p>
<pre>&lt;copy file=&quot;http://www.mywebsite.org/document.html&quot;
      tofile=&quot;${basedir}/doc/document.html&quot;
/&gt; </pre>
<p>Want would assume that all URIs that don't specify a protocol have an
implicit protocol of &quot;file:&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>** AFTER-NOTE **</h2>
<p>This scheme seems too complicated, both in implementation and in the
semantics exposed to the users. </p>
<p>One of the largest problems would be FileSets that contain references to
different resources on different servers. Normally, establishing connections to
remote servers is expensive, so it would be silly to open an FTP connection
three times because the same server appears three times on the list of paths on
non-consecutive positions.</p>
<p>A better approach (and the one used by Ant) is to define per-protocol tasks.
Scripts can use those tasks to and from the local hard disk, and work from
there. The standard tasks copy, move, and delete, and the libraries that
implement them would remain unpolluted.</p>
<pre>&lt;target name=&quot;getdoc&quot; &gt; 
  &lt;http server=&quot;www.mywebsite.org&quot; 
        localdir=&quot;${basedir}/doc&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;include name=&quot;document.html&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/http&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;</pre>
<p>Supporting wildcards in per-protocol tasks may require implementing some of
the ideas below. For example, the handling of wildcards should probably be moved
away from the path handling module, which would then become
protocol-independent, and into TFileSet, where it can be overridden by
per-protocol implementations.</p>
<pre>TFTPFileSet = class(TFileSet)
protected
  // protocol-specific implementation of FindPaths
  // some implementations can just throw an error
  function FindPaths(Pattern :TPath; BasePath :TPath) :TPaths; overriride;
  // the &quot;Wild&quot; routines, whose main purpose is handling 
  // of &quot;**&quot; patterns, would remain the same
end;</pre>
<p>If the above is done, then standard file tasks could be allowed to specify
protocol specific filesets.</p>
<pre>&lt;copy todir=&quot;${basedir}/doc&quot; &gt;
  &lt;httpfileset basedir=&quot;http://www.mywebsite.org&quot; 
               user=&quot;john&quot;
               password=&quot;secret&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;get name=&quot;document.html /&gt;
  &lt;/httpfileset&gt;
&lt;/copy&gt;</pre>
<h2>** OLD NOTES ** </h2>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Delphi, the system/language in which&nbsp; Want is written, is all set up
for managing and accessing files that reside on the local disk, but it provides
zero facilities for accessing resources elsewhere (on the Web, on FTP servers,
etc). It would be desirable to have Want <b>transparently</b> manage URIs and
the resources they point to on behalf of task writers, so it becomes straight
forward to implement tasks that lets users specify.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>Build a library that can perform the standard file operations (query, copy,
move, delete, open, read, write, close) on resources specified as URIs.</p>
<p>Different types of URIs require different kinds of logic for managing pointed
resources. For atomic operations like query, copy, move, and delete, a single,
entry-point routine can dispatch to the appropriate implementation routine by
examining the protocol part of the URI.</p>
<p>To implement open, read, write, and close, which must be dispatched based on
the type of the resource (a local file versus a remote http document), a more
object oriented approach is necessary.</p>
<p>The solution is to define a stream class for&nbsp; each kind of protocol (TFTPStream,
THTTPStream, etc.), and a TURIStream that creates a delegate stream of the
appropriate type for the resource , and forwards all subsequent operations
(read, write, and close) to the delegate.</p>
<pre>function TURIStream.Read(var Buffer; Count :Integer):Integer;
begin
  Result := FDelegate.Read(Buffer, Count);
end;</pre>
Taking the object-orientedness a bit further, atomic operations (query, copy,
delete, move) could be implemented by a TURI class. That way, the choice of
implementations (http:, ftp:) would be done only once, at TURI instantiation.
This would provide the advantage of being able to implement some operations in
terms of others. For example:
<pre>procedure MoveResource(FromPath, ToPath :TPath);
var
  FromURI :TURI;
begin
  FromURI := URI(FromPath);
  FromURI.CopyTo(ToPath);
  FromURI.Delete;
end;
</pre>
<h3>Handling Wildcards in Remote Protocol Paths</h3>
<p>For a sessionless protocol like http://server.com/**, one can do the
following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add index.html, index.htm, and default.asp to the list of unprocessed
    links.</li>
  <li>Finish if the list of unprocessed links is empty.</li>
  <li>Get the next unprocessed link.</li>
  <li>Add the link to the list of processed (result) links. </li>
  <li>Retreive the document pointed to by the link.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Get the list of links inside the document.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Add the document links which are relative to the list of unprocessed
    links. </li>
</ol>
<p>For the ftp: protocol, which can provide directory listings, the work is more
like the one for local files.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<pre>type
  TURI = record
    Protocol  :string;
    Server    :string;
    Path      :string;
    Resource  :string;
    Extension :string;
  end;

function SplitURI(URI :string) :TURI;

function PathIsAbsolute(Path :TPath) :boolean;
begin
  with SplitURI(Path) do
    if (Protocol= '') or (Protocol = 'file:') then
      Result := Copy(Path, 1, 1) = '/'
    else 
      Result := True;
end;</pre>
