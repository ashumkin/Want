<h1>Want History </h1>
<p>On the Spring of 2001 several <a href="http://www.suigeneris.org/dunit/">
DUnit</a> developers, including me, were complaining about the unreliability of 
the Make build tool on all platforms. We've just had some problems building
<a href="http://www.suigeneris.org/dunit/">DUnit</a> with Make. </p>
<p>We discussed long about how a build tool should be like, and several of us 
tough that it should be like <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">
Ant</a>, the tool used in the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org">Apache-Jakarta</a> 
project. The problem with Ant itself was that we thought it was too 
Java-centered to be useful in a Delphi project. </p>
<p>A group of us decided to create our own tool, and thus end our sufferings 
with Make. After a short discussion, we decided that its name would be Dante, 
and we went on to work. </p>
<h3>Start </h3>
<p>Chris Morris (chrismo) set up a Source Forge project for Dante and got 
authorization from his employer to contribute some useful source code. I built a 
basic framework for buildng projects and implemented script persistence using 
Delphi's DFM format (the one used for forms). We had our first working prototype 
by day two. </p>
<h3>Week One </h3>
<p>Within a week I had incorporated my SAX/XML&nbsp; <span lang="en-us">classes 
from the JAL library </span>and Dante was able to read scripts in XML, much like 
the ones used by <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">Ant</a>. 
That week Chris wrote basic &lt;exec&gt; and &lt;dcc&gt; (Delphi compile) tasks for Dante. I 
took it from there, added exe output redirection to &lt;exec&gt;, filled the voids in 
&lt;dcc&gt;, and Dante became able to build itself. </p>
<h3>Week Two </h3>
<p>By the end of week two I had developed a file path library that could handle 
Ant-like wildcards in a (hopefully) platform independent way. The library let me 
implement <span lang="en-us">&lt;copy&gt;</span>, <span lang="en-us">&lt;m</span>ove<span lang="en-us">&gt;</span>,
<span lang="en-us">&lt;d</span>elete<span lang="en-us">&gt;</span>, and
<span lang="en-us">&lt;t</span>ouch<span lang="en-us">&gt;</span> tasks that worked 
very much like Ant's. I added
<a href="http://www.nomssi.de/paszlib/paszlib.html">Nomssi Nzali's port</a> of
<a href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/">ZLib 1.1.2</a> to the mix, and implemented 
the Zip task with it. </p>
<h3>Week Three </h3>
<p>By week three Chris had incorporated a thorough set of unit and external 
tests using the <a href="http://www.suigeneris.org/dunit/">DUnit</a> testing 
framework, and the few bugs present were jumping out the door. Chris's design 
enabled us to create external tests without writing a single line of code. </p>
<p>That week Mike Taylor (mtaylor) started providing feedback on refactorings 
that would make the source code more efficient and clearer. </p>
<p>By the end of the week Dante was able to build DUnit using a
<a href="dunit_want.xml">fairly complex build script</a>. </p>
<h3>Week Four </h3>
<p>On week four, I broke out of the Dante developers group, and continued 
developing the tool by myself under the name &quot;Want&quot; (the reasons for the breakup 
remain a mystery). I refactored the core classes and stripped them of 
dependencies to the particular XML parser, and wrote a DUnit task that is able 
to run DUnit test cases compiled as DLLs. </p>
<h3>Week Five </h3>
<p>By week five Want was the official build tool for DUnit. I was using Want for 
all my new projects, and gradually porting old (mostly Make) projects to Want.
</p>
<h3>Today </h3>
<p>Want is under constant use and constant development. <span lang="en-us">The 
project has moved to <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/want/">Source 
Forge</a> and project administration is now in the hands of Ignacio (Nacho) 
Ortega &lt;nacho at siapi dot es&gt;. Nacho, Mike Johnson &lt;csmajohnson at hotmail dot 
com&gt; and other developers are making improvements to the tools and new releases 
are on the way.</span></p>
