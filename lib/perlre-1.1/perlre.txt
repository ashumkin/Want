  Version 1.1

  Last Updated: 3-Mar-99

  This is the Delphi4 wrapper for perlre.dll, the win32 port of
  Philip Hazel's PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expression) package.
  PCRE itself can be found at:

Using TPerlRe

TPerlRe is just a class wrapper to interface with perlre.dll.  I use Delphi4's overloading and default paramater quite a bit, so if you use an older version you'll have to make some modifications.  The interface is as follows:

    property RegExp: string
		the regex pattern

    property Options: integer
		ORed values of the following: see pcre.html for explanation of these
		options
		  PCRE_CASELESS
		  PCRE_MULTILINE
		  PCRE_DOTALL
		  PCRE_SINGLELINE
		  PCRE_EXTENDED
		  PCRE_ANCHORED
		  PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY
		  PCRE_EXTRA
		  PCRE_NOTBOL
		  PCRE_NOTEOL
		  PCRE_UNGREEDY

    property Text: string
		subject text to match

    property SubExp[I:integer]: TSubExp
		returns info for the Ith subexpression, where 0th expression
		is the entire matching string
		TSubExp stores 1) the subexpression string; 2) the 1-based index
		of the subexpression into Text; and 3) length of subexpression.

    property SubExpCount: integer
		returns how many sub expressions were matched (not incl. the 0th one)
		
    constructor Create( doStudy: boolean=true; opts:integer=DefaultOpts);
		set doStudy to false if you don't want to study the regex,
		i.e., optimize it.
		(If you use the regex inside a loop, chances are you DO want to
		study it.)

    procedure Reset;
		TPerlre keeps an internal pointer of current position in the
		Text, so that successive calls to Match will find more occurrences.

    procedure Split( const regexp: string; str: string; elems:
                     TStrings; doTrim: boolean=true);
		similar to Perl's split command
		doTrim=true => trim leading and trailing space of split strings.

    procedure Compile( const regexp: string); overload;
    procedure Compile( const regexp: string; MatchCase: boolean); overload;
    procedure Compile( const regexp: string; opts: integer); overload;
		different variations of Compile; not strictly necessary, just
		makes life simpler for me.

    function Match: boolean; overload;
    function Match( const str: string): boolean; overload;
    function Match( const regexp, str: string): boolean; overload;
    function Match( const regexp, str: string; opts: integer): boolean;
                                                               overload;
		Same here.  The last 3 matches function simply sets 
		the parameters then call Match()

Here's a simple example of TPerlre at work:

function SaneEmail( const Str: string):boolean;
begin
  with TPerlre.Create( false, 0) do
  Try
    Result:=Match( '^[^@ ]+\@[^@ ]+\.[^@ ]+$', Str);
  Finally
    Free;
  end;
end;

2) Known issues.

I did not completely port some functions, notably those in maketables.c which allows you to define character tables for foreign languages and locales.

Version 1.1+ uses 2 obj files built with Borland C Builder and no longer requires a DLL.  The package will simply be compiled into your app.
