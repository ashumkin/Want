WANT is a Delphi-friendly build tool. See the file:

  doc/index.html 

for more information about WANT.

EXECUTING WANT

There's a copy of want.exe under the "bin" directory.

BUILDING AND TESTING WANT

Please use the make\bootstrap.bat script to build WANT for the first time.
N.B. brcc32 must be in a PATH. And DELPHI_VERSION environment variable must
match Delphi compiler version used to compile WANT (11 is for Delphi 2007).

After that, you can place a copy of bin\want.exe on a different directory, and
use that copy to continue building WANT.
