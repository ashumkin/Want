PASZLIB-SG
Copyright (C) 2003 by Sergey A. Galin.

This library is a modified version of PASZLIB (Copyright (C) 1998, 1999, 2000 
by NOMSSI NZALI Jacques H. C.), a Pascal port of zlib 1.1.2, a general purpose 
data compression library (Copyright (C) 1995-1998 by Mark Adler).
See README.txt in subdirectory paszlib for more information.

Major differences from PASZLIB 1.0
==================================
  
  1. May be compiled under Delphi 6+ and Kylix, but compatibility with older 
     Pascal versions is lost,
  2. Error handling (in all new units) is exception-driven. No need to back to 
     old "IOResult" style.     
  3. gzXXX functions operate on Streams (great flexibility!)
  4. TGZip class - handy object-oriented interface!
  
  5. Added more classes to allow multi-file store many compressed files
     in one stream...
